Installation
------------

**pynuml** is available on PyPi, and can be installed easily using::

    pip install pynuml

If you're setting up the repository for development, you can also clone it and install it in editable mode::

    git clone https://github.com/vhewes/pynuml
    pip install -e ./pynuml

If installed in editable mode, any changes made to the package will instantaneously be reflected when the module is imported in python.
